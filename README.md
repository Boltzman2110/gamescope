## Tech

Python | pandas | Matplotlib | Folium | Plotly Express | Streamlit 

## Data

We have used the "Global Video Game Sales & Ratings" dataset from Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/thedevastator/global-video-game-sales-ratings). The dataset consists of records from Metacritic providing insight into global video game ratings and sales. It contains data such as publisher, genre, year of release, and sales information.

## Methodology

1 - Preprocessing: We dropped the unnecessary columns, normalized the values in the sales columns, merged rows that showed data for the same video game and their corresponding data.

2 - Visualization: We used folium to create a world map to make it visually appealing and interesting to navigate the data. We used plotly express to generate bar and pie charts to analyze the sales data.

3 - Dashboard: We created the dashboard using Streamlit and hosted using Streamlit Cloud.
